### Steps to use the model:
- Download Dullrazor from http://www.dermweb.com/dull_razor/
- To segment images ->  open main.m edit your image source file location and output file location and run.
- These matlab code will work in matlab17a or higher (If you are using higher versions then change the code respectively).
- To generate different sets of texture features use different create feature programs ( you can find files named like _createFeature1.m_)
- Use SMOTE.m if your number of images according to classes are not balanced (To improve accuracy).
